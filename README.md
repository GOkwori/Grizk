# UX/UI - User Experience/User Interface

## Design Inspiration

Grizk’s design captures the essence of modern tech elegance, leveraging a sleek, dark-themed aesthetic that echoes sophistication and innovation. The primary colour scheme revolves around jet black (`#000`) as the background, paired with striking orange-red (`#ff4500`) accents, symbolizing energy and cutting-edge technology. This colour combination is not only visually appealing but also enhances the readability and focus of the content across all devices.

The site maintains a responsive design, ensuring that users on mobile, tablet, and desktop can seamlessly navigate through Grizk’s interface. Key visual elements such as buttons, icons, and product cards are intuitively designed to stand out against the dark background, ensuring that users can quickly identify interactive components.

A minimalist logo, designed using [LogoAI](https://www.logoai.com), is prominently displayed as the favicon and brand signature across the site. The logo’s clean lines and bold colours reinforce the store’s identity as a go-to destination for high-tech enthusiasts.

![Grizk logo](documentation/features/logo.PNG)  
*Grizk logo*

## Dark Theme with Electric Accents

The dark-themed design, with a solid black background, was chosen not only for its sleek, high-tech appearance but also to provide a comfortable, strain-free experience for users browsing for extended periods. Orange-red highlights are strategically used to emphasize calls to action, such as "Add to Cart" and "Checkout," ensuring these elements are easily noticeable.

Buttons across the site feature a smooth hover effect where the colours invert — from black with red accents to a red background with black text. This visual feedback enhances user interactions and draws attention to clickable elements.

## Header & Navigation

The header employs a radial gradient (`#220202` to `#000000`), giving a subtle, polished look that matches the dark theme. Navigation elements are styled with bold, orange-red text that is easy to read and aligns with the overall visual consistency. 

The navigation bar remains sticky across all screens, ensuring users can access essential sections such as the cart, profile, and categories without scrolling back up. For a seamless experience, dropdown menus and off-canvas sections (for wishlist and cart) match the site’s dark theme and accent colours, providing a unified visual presentation.

![Header Navigation](documentation/features/navigation.PNG)  
*Intuitive header and navigation for streamlined browsing*

## Footer Design

The footer continues the radial gradient design, providing a cohesive finish to each page. It features social media icons that subtly increase in size when hovered over, inviting users to connect without overwhelming the screen. Subscription forms are embedded within bordered panels, elegantly styled with orange-red outlines that stand out against the dark background, encouraging users to engage with newsletters and updates.

![Footer Design](documentation/features/footer.PNG)

## Product Showcase & Visual Feedback

Product images are displayed in a clean, distraction-free layout to ensure the gadgets are the center of attention. Each product card is designed to hover slightly when interacted with, giving a sense of depth and enhancing the overall user experience. The site employs a flexbox grid system to arrange products dynamically, ensuring consistency across varying screen sizes.

Visual feedback is implemented throughout the interface, including subtle animations and hover effects. For example, toasts pop up on the right side of the screen to confirm actions like adding items to the cart or removing products from the wishlist, ensuring users are always informed.

## Dual Carousel Implementation

### Home Page Carousel (Landing)

Upon entering the Grizk site, users are greeted by a captivating carousel on the homepage. This landing carousel showcases the latest promotions, featured products, and exclusive offers. Each slide features high-resolution product images, a brief description, and a prominent call-to-action button ("Explore Now), styled with the site's signature colours. 

The carousel uses smooth slide transitions (`transform 0.3s ease-in-out`) to create an engaging browsing experience. Users can navigate through slides using intuitive swipe gestures on mobile devices or click through arrows on desktops. The design ensures a seamless, immersive first impression, setting the tone for a sophisticated shopping journey.

### Top Deals Carousel

Further down on the homepage, a secondary carousel highlights top deals, seasonal promotions, and special offers. This section follows a similar design but emphasizes discounts and limited-time offers. Each product card within the carousel is designed to slightly enlarge on hover (`scale(1.05)`), giving a sense of interactivity and depth. The hover effect draws users' attention to these key deals, encouraging exploration.

Both carousels adapt seamlessly across devices, ensuring consistent viewing experiences whether on mobile or desktop. Image resizing and responsive text adjustments allow for clear, legible content presentation without compromising aesthetics.

## Cart & Wishlist Off-Canvas Design

### Off-Canvas Cart

Grizk introduces an off-canvas cart feature that slides in from the side of the screen when activated. This allows users to quickly view and manage their cart items without leaving the current page. 

The cart's design follows the dark theme, with the bright accent colours ensuring important details like item names, quantities, and prices stand out. Buttons to "Checkout" and "Continue Shopping" invert colours on hover, providing immediate feedback to user actions. Each product listed has quantity adjustment controls and a "Remove" button, giving users full control over their purchases.

### Off-Canvas Wishlist

The off-canvas wishlist functions similarly to the cart, enabling users to save products for later. This panel slides in smoothly, showing all saved products with options to add them to the cart or remove them from the wishlist. The same dark colour scheme and accent colours maintain consistency, ensuring users know they are still within the Grizk environment.

Both off-canvas panels are designed to be responsive, adjusting seamlessly to smaller screens. Controls are adequately spaced, and scrollbars appear as needed, ensuring smooth navigation and usability.

![Cart & Wishlist Off-Canvas](./documentation/features/offcanvas.PNG)  
*Seamlessly integrated off-canvas panels for cart and wishlist*


## Responsive Design & Media Queries

Grizk’s design is fully responsive, utilizing media queries to adapt layouts for different devices. For instance, elements adjust seamlessly between mobile views (`max-width: 320px`) and larger desktops (`min-width: 1801px`), ensuring a smooth and consistent experience. Features like dropdowns, carousels, and off-canvas components scale appropriately, providing intuitive navigation and user interaction across all platforms.

*Consistent, responsive design for all screen sizes*

## Animations & Transitions

Animations are carefully integrated to enhance user interaction without detracting from the browsing experience. For instance, product images gently enlarge on hover (`scale(1.05)`) to draw focus, while buttons smoothly change colour on hover, indicating interactivity. This provides a polished, fluid user experience that aligns with Grizk’s futuristic aesthetic.

Grizk is designed not just as an e-commerce platform but as a digital shopping experience that embodies the sophistication of the tech products it offers. Through thoughtful design, intuitive navigation, and responsive elements, Grizk ensures users are fully engaged from browsing to checkout, no matter their device.

### Colour Scheme

![Grizk colour Scheme](./documentation/colour-palette/colour_palette.PNG)  
*Grizk colour Scheme*

Grizk employs a bold, modern colour palette that emphasizes contrast and clarity, essential for an electronics e-commerce platform. The CSS uses well-defined variables to ensure consistency across the site:

- `--electric-orange`: #ff4500;
- `--deep-black`: #000;
- `--midnight-maroon`: #220202;
- `--soft-gray`: #22223b;
- `--vivid-white`: #fff;
- `--steel-gray`: #aab7c4;
- `--bright-yellow`: #ffc824;

These colours were chosen to provide a sleek, high-tech aesthetic that appeals to tech enthusiasts. The primary colour, `electric-orange` (#ff4500), serves as a bright accent used throughout the site, from call-to-action buttons to hyperlinks and notifications. It ensures that essential elements stand out against the dark, muted backgrounds, guiding users' attention seamlessly. 

### Primary and Accent colours

The `deep-black` (#000) background delivers a sophisticated, minimalist canvas, allowing the `electric-orange` to shine as the main accent colour. This vibrant hue is featured prominently on buttons, interactive elements, and hover effects, ensuring that users can intuitively navigate the site. A touch of `midnight-maroon` (#220202) adds depth and warmth, subtly incorporated in background gradients and header elements to break up the dark theme without overwhelming the user.

### Button and Interactive Elements

Interactive elements on Grizk, such as buttons and clickable links, employ a striking colour contrast. The standard button style features a `black` background with `electric-orange` borders and text, creating a dynamic, eye-catching appearance. On hover, the colours invert—buttons light up in `electric-orange` while the text turns `black`. This creates a clear, responsive visual cue, enhancing the user’s experience and interaction with the site.

![Grizk Main Button](./documentation/features/button.PNG)  
*Grizk Main Button Design*

### Consistency and Feedback Mechanisms

Grizk utilizes `soft-gray` (#22223b) for secondary backgrounds, borders, and certain text elements to maintain visual balance. When users interact with fields or buttons, a `bright-yellow` (#ffc824) or `electric-orange` appears to provide immediate feedback, confirming the action is available or complete. This approach simplifies navigation, making it easy for users to understand where they are on the site and how they can interact with it.

### Accessibility and Contrast Testing

Colour accessibility is a priority for Grizk. Using [Adobe colour](https://colour.adobe.com/create/colour-accessibility), we ensured that all primary text and essential visual elements meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast. This makes the site accessible to users with visual impairments. Below are examples of how these tests were conducted to guarantee clarity and usability:

![Grizk colour Accessibility Check](./documentation/colour-palette/color-accessibility.PNG)  
*Grizk colour Accessibility Check*

### Button Contrast

Buttons were rigorously tested to ensure that they are easy to see and interact with on both desktop and mobile devices. colour contrasts between the `electric-orange` and background hues ensure that buttons remain legible under various lighting conditions. This helps prevent misclicks and guides users smoothly through their shopping experience.

![Grizk colour Contrast Check - Button](docs/readme_images/grizk_button_contrast.png)  
*Grizk Button Contrast Check*

### Final Thoughts

Grizk’s colour scheme contributes to a sleek, cohesive design that resonates with tech-savvy users. The high-contrast, minimalist aesthetic emphasizes usability, drawing attention to key actions and features. Consistency across the site ensures a seamless experience, whether users are browsing on desktop or mobile. The combination of `electric-orange` accents with deep, muted backgrounds fosters an inviting yet sophisticated feel, enhancing the overall brand identity of Grizk.

### Typography & Iconography

![Grizk Font Pairing](docs/readme_images/grizk_fontpair.png)  
*Grizk Font Pairing*

For Grizk, typography was chosen to convey a sense of modernity, precision, and clarity, essential for an electronics e-commerce platform where users need to quickly grasp product information. The primary typeface used is **Roboto**. 

**Roboto** serves as the main sans-serif font, providing a sleek, modern, and easily readable style that aligns with the brand's high-tech image. It is used extensively for titles, headings, and important labels across the platform, ensuring content is presented clearly and prominently. On the other hand, **Fira Code**, a monospaced font, was chosen for product details and specifications, emphasizing the technical aspects of the electronics listed on the site. This combination provides a robust contrast that enhances the readability and structure of the content, improving the overall user experience.

### Iconography

Grizk's iconography complements its clean, modern aesthetic, using simple, clear icons from the **Font Awesome** library. Icons are employed strategically to guide users through their journey on the site—whether it’s adding products to the cart, favoriting items, or navigating different categories. For example, the shopping cart, wishlist heart, and user account icons are immediately recognizable and provide visual cues to users, enhancing their navigation experience.

### Project Planning

## Strategy Plane

The key objective for Grizk was to create a robust and intuitive e-commerce platform for sophisticated tech gadgets, ensuring seamless UX and efficient navigation. The site was developed to align with modern standards, offering all expected features of a high-performance e-commerce store while focusing on user engagement and a straightforward shopping experience. 

**Core Features Include:**
- **Responsive Design:** Accessible on all devices, from desktops to mobiles, ensuring the user can shop comfortably anywhere.
- **Guest and User Accounts:** Visitors can freely browse as guests or register to unlock additional features like wishlists and order tracking.
- **Integrated Payment System:** Secure checkout provided via **Stripe**, simplifying the purchase process and building customer trust.
- **Wishlist & Notifications:** Allow users to keep track of products they are interested in, with easy access via off-canvas panels.

The design process incorporated tools like **Figma** for wireframing and prototyping, and custom CSS ensured a coherent and attractive visual presentation across all devices. Grizk also integrates SEO best practices, ensuring optimal search engine visibility and improved traffic.

### Development Approach

Grizk was built using a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, enhanced by frameworks like **Bootstrap** to facilitate responsive design, and **jQuery** to streamline interactive elements. To maintain consistency and speed up the process, **CSS variables** were used extensively. For example, colors and fonts are declared at the beginning of the stylesheet, enabling rapid adjustments and scaling.

![Grizk Main Development Tools](docs/readme_images/grizk_tools.png)  
*Grizk Development Stack*

### Cart & Wishlist Off-Canvas Design

The **off-canvas panels** for the cart and wishlist provide a user-friendly, modern way to manage selected items without leaving the current page. These panels slide in from the side, offering easy access to products added to the cart or wishlist. Users can remove items, adjust quantities, and view total costs directly within these panels.

![Grizk Cart Off-Canvas](docs/readme_images/grizk_cart_offcanvas.png)  
*Cart Off-Canvas Design*  
![Grizk Wishlist Off-Canvas](docs/readme_images/grizk_wishlist_offcanvas.png)  
*Wishlist Off-Canvas Design*

### Interactive Feedback with Toasts & Notifications

Toasts and notifications play a critical role in enhancing the user experience. Whenever users add items to their cart, remove products, or complete a purchase, Grizk provides instant feedback using toast notifications. These toasts are styled with the site's core color scheme, ensuring they fit seamlessly into the overall design. 

### Planning for Future Integration

Grizk's future development roadmap includes features such as:
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:** Allowing users to see live stock updates as they shop.
- **Product Recommendations Engine:** Using machine learning algorithms to suggest related products based on user behavior.
- **Enhanced Search Functionality:** Implementing advanced filtering and sorting options to help users find exactly what they're looking for quickly.

The project’s planning phase involved detailed wireframes and prototypes created in Figma, ensuring every feature was thoughtfully laid out and tested before implementation. The cohesive design language, from typography to iconography, ensures that the site delivers a premium shopping experience from start to finish.

The colour scheme of AccountSphere has been deliberately selected to establish a professional, clear, and appealing interface that enhances usability and visual aesthetics. The primary colour used throughout the platform include shades of grey and vibrant highlights, which not only create a modern look but also aid in distinguishing between different UI elements effectively. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the colour palette:

- `#3a405a (Slate Blue)`: Serving as the dominant background and accent colour, this shade defines the overall visual identity of the platform. It appears prominently in the navbar, buttons, and cards, providing a professional look that conveys sophistication and confidence.

- `#ffffff (White)`: White is primarily used for the text and main background of forms, dashboards, and other elements, ensuring high contrast and readability. This universal and clean shade gives a fresh and uncluttered feel to the user interface.

- `#fff (White) and #3a405a (Slate Blue)`: The combination of these colour makes interactive buttons prominent, enhancing the navigation and actions across the interface. These colour also highlight key UI elements and cards to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

- `#fff (White) and Black for Buttons`: For the buttons, a classic white-on-black and black-on-white contrast is employed, creating visual appeal and drawing attention to call-to-action areas.

- `#000000 (Black)`: Appears in close buttons and provides contrast against white backgrounds.

- `#f0f0f0 (Light Gray`): Used for the news panel to differentiate the section and improve content readability.

- `Slate Blue Accents`: Various UI components, such as panels, headlines, and borders, are highlighted in slate blue to maintain consistency across the platform. These accents are crucial for intuitive navigation and visual hierarchy.

- `News Panel Accent`: The news panel utilises a subtle gradient of white and grey to distinguish it from other sections. This panel retains the visual theme but incorporates a gentle distinction to improve the readability of content.

![Colour Scheme](./accountsphere/static/documentation/colour_palette/colour-palette.PNG)

This carefully curated colour scheme leverages a mix of neutral tones and vibrant accents to create a professional, engaging, and accessible platform. The deliberate use of white and slate blue ensures that essential information stands out, while the uniformity across the platform provides a seamless experience for users navigating through different sections of AccountSphere.

### Typography

For the typography of AccountSphere, the Roboto font from Google Fonts was selected to align with the platform's modern and professional aesthetic.

- `Primary Font: Roboto` - This sans-serif typeface offers a clean, contemporary look that enhances the platform's user experience. Its narrow letterforms and balanced proportions lend themselves well to both headings and body text, ensuring clarity and legibility across various screen sizes and devices.

![Colour Scheme](./accountsphere/static/documentation/google_font/google-fonts.PNG)

The use of Roboto throughout AccountSphere reinforces the platform's focus on streamlined functionality and effective communication. This font choice complements the platform's focus on financial management and business operations, providing a professional yet approachable appearance that aligns with the target audience's needs and preferences.

### Imagery

The imagery used in AccountSphere enhances the user experience by creating a visually engaging and professional platform that aligns with its financial management focus. The visual elements have been carefully curated to reflect the platform's branding and thematic focus, providing a cohesive and appealing atmosphere for users.

- `Background Images`: The background images for AccountSphere are high-quality visuals that align with the platform's business-oriented focus. These images, sourced from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/), provide a clean and modern backdrop that supports the user interface without overwhelming it. The choice of images ensures a professional appearance that resonates with the platform's audience.

- `Iconography and Logo`: The logo and icons used in AccountSphere reflect the platform's emphasis on financial management and business operations. The logo, a stylised representation of financial elements, serves as a visual anchor for the site, reinforcing the platform's identity and purpose. The icons, sourced from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/), offer clear visual communication and thematic consistency, enhancing the platform's usability and user experience.

### Wireframes

The development of AccountSphere began with the creation of detailed wireframes that outlined the structure and layout of each page. These wireframes served as the visual blueprint for designing a user-friendly interface that ensures a seamless experience across the platform. 

Each wireframe was crafted with careful attention to user experience, emphasising intuitive navigation and efficient workflows that align with the goals of various user roles, including administrators, account officers, product managers, and news analysts.

These flowcharts illustrate the interactions between users and the system, highlighting key functionalities and decision points within AccountSphere. They ensure that the platform is designed to meet user needs effectively while maintaining robust security and operational efficiency.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provides a visual overview of the relationships and data structure within the AccountSphere application. This diagram illustrates how different data entities such as users, groups, accounts, products, and news items interact with each other, helping to clarify the system's architecture.

The ERD is crucial for understanding how data is organised, stored, and accessed within the application. Each entity corresponds to a table in the database, with attributes representing the columns of that table. Relationships between entities, indicated by lines, depict foreign key constraints, showing how data is linked together.

In this diagram:

- `User`: Represents an individual accessing the platform, who belongs to a specific group.
- `Group`: Contains information about various user groups for role-based access management.
- `Account`: Represents financial accounts linked to a specific product.
- `Product`: Contains details about products available within the system, each having a unique association with multiple accounts.
- `NewsItem`: Contains information about various news articles related to finance.

![ERD](./accountsphere/static/documentation/entity_diagram/erd.PNG)

This diagram not only showcases the logical structure of the database but also provides insight into how CRUD operations are performed across different modules in the application. Understanding this structure is essential for maintaining, enhancing, and scaling the application over time.

### Role-Based Access Control

The application employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and ensure that only authorised users can access certain functionalities. This approach enhances security by limiting access to sensitive operations based on the user's role within the system.

#### `Roles Defined`
- **Administrator:** Has the highest level of access, including managing users, groups, products, accounts, and news items.
- **Account Officer:** Responsible for managing accounts, including adding and editing accounts.
- **News Analyst:** Responsible for managing news items, including adding, editing, and deleting news.
- **Product Manager:** Responsible for managing products, including adding and editing products.

#### `RBAC Implementation`

RBAC is implemented using a decorator function, `role_required`, which checks if the currently logged-in user has the required role(s) to access a specific route. If the user does not have the necessary permissions, they are redirected to the profile page with a flash message indicating insufficient permissions.

#### `Administrator Role Protection`

To protect the administrator role from being selected by public users during registration, it is excluded from the list of roles presented in the registration form. This is done by filtering out the 'Administrator' role from the available options.

| 2 | `Login redirect error` | After successful login, users were not redirected to their profile page. | Implemented a redirect to the profile page upon successful authentication. |
| 3 | `Database connection timeout` | The application experienced frequent database timeouts. | Optimised database queries and revalidated database connection settings. |
| 4 | `Responsive layout issues` | Some pages were not displaying correctly on mobile devices. | Applied additional responsive CSS fixes to ensure compatibility across all devices. |
| 5 | `Search functionality not working` | The search feature in user management was returning incorrect results. | Refined the search algorithm to accurately filter and display results based on user queries. |
| 6 | `Security vulnerability in user session` | A security vulnerability was discovered that could allow an unauthorised user to access session data. | Enhanced session management and implemented additional security checks. |
| 7 | `Missing error messages` | Error messages were not displayed to the user on failed login attempts. | Added error handling to catch and display appropriate feedback messages to the user. |
| 8 | `Product deletion error` | Users were unable to delete products due to a foreign key constraint error. | Adjusted the database schema to properly handle deletions with cascade rules. |
| 9 | `Group management access rights` | Non-administrative users were able to access and modify group settings. | Revised access controls to restrict group management functionalities to administrators only. |
